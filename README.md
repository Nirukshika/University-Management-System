# University-Management-System

This is a  **University Management System** project written in Java that provides functionalities to manage student data efficiently. The system allows users to register new students with a unique ID and name, cancel registrations, search for students by their ID, and manage student academic results such as module marks and grades. Additionally, it supports file operations to save student details into a file and load them back into the system for future use. Students can be viewed in a sorted order based on their names or academic performance. The project includes proper input validations for student IDs, names, and module marks to ensure data integrity. It consists of three main classes: the **Main** class, which handles the menu-driven interface and user interactions; the **Student** class, which represents the student's details, including their grades; and the **Module** class, which manages module marks and calculates totals and averages. This program is ideal for small academic institutions or projects to manage student records effectively.
